# types-of-cvd-simulator-app

A Python script using the daltonlens library to simulate different color vision deficiencies (CVD) on an input image. The script opens a file dialog to choose an image, applies the daltonlens simulator to the image to simulate protanopia, deuteranopia, and tritanopia, and saves the simulated images as well as a grayscale version of the original image.
